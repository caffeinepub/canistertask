  "summary": "The diff implements a complete user profile system with 'MEU PERFIL' navigation, MyProfile and PublicProfile pages, updated Header navigation, translation keys, routing, and admin dashboard platform fee display. However, several backend requirements are missing, and some frontend features show placeholder/mock data instead of backend integration.",

      "requirement": "Add backend query method to retrieve user profile data including calculated rating from completed tasks, total earnings with 7% platform fee, today's earnings, completed and pending task counts, and recent task history with timestamps",
      "reason": "Backend main.mo shows getUserProfile and getCallerUserProfile methods exist, but the diff does not show implementation of rating calculation, earnings with 7% fee tracking, today's earnings, completed/pending task counts, or recent task history with timestamps. Frontend files show mock/placeholder data (completedTasks = 0, rating = 0, empty recentTasks array) suggesting backend methods do not return this data.",
