- Create professional worker profile cards showing avatar, name, star rating with task count, location with distance, hourly rate, skills, total earnings (GAINHOS), last completed task with timestamp, and [Contratar] [Ver tasks] buttons
- Update main navigation menu to include Home, Tasks, Meu Perfil, Workers, and Admin sections with Workers link navigating to worker listings
- Ensure free trial test mode functionality works with simulated 7% platform fee calculation displayed on completed tasks
